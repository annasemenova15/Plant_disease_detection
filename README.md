# Plant disease detection

## The project is dedicated to plant disease detection, which is a binary classification task. 

The model that will predict if a plant has any disease brings several interrelated values to the agriculture industry. It helps to save some part of the harvest by detecting the existence of disease, allowing us to take actions timely and cure the plant. In turn it would reduce the cost which usually arises when a part of the crops are dying. In addition, it saves the human workforce, because there would be no need to manually check if the plant is healthy, and the process would be automated. 

We could potentially estimate the exact financial effect of this project by focusing on the false negatives, since in our case the situation when we do not identify a disease leads to the loss of a plant and of a potential revenue. Therefore, for the key metric of the model we can use either a traditional F1 score or F-beta score, assigning more weight to recall. We will provide more information on metrics later.

For the project [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) from Kaggle will be used.
